## Welcome

This is the first post on my new site. I built this from scratch using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and markdown — no Wix, no templates, just code.

## What to expect

I'll be writing about:

- Data engineering patterns and pipelines
- Analytics and visualization projects
- Tools and technologies I'm exploring
- Lessons learned from real-world data work

## Why blog?

Writing forces clarity of thought. If I can explain something well in a post, I understand it. Plus, it's a way to document the journey and share what I've learned along the way.

Stay tuned for more.
